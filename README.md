##Permission info
Extension needs permission to work in every chrome tab. It is because of different URLs to access APEX application builder. Plugin attaches its functionality only if jQuery selector is being found after page loads. The selector defines standard report column attributes – area where new functionality should be available. Extension doesnt’ collect any data from user's browser.
